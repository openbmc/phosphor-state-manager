      "message": "Hi, we have taken some time to verify if hard-coding the service name works. However, there is still a chance it results in a timeout. Given that our system has eight server boards, each with an expansion board, I think it might be too busy, which could be causing the busctl command to time out.",

      "message": "With performance issues it\u0027s usually best to address the root problem vs. starting to add bigger timeouts on things. But if you\u0027ve talked with Patrick and all agree that this is best because your BMC is maxed out, then at a minimum this timeout would need to be passed in via a config file for the service. i.e. By default the config file just does the standard dbus timeout and then you can override it for your system.",
