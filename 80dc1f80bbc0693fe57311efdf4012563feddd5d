The old code:\npohTimer.setEnabled(chassisPowerState \u003d\u003d PowerState::On);\nWould pass a false to setEnabled when power was off, so we would stop the timer when chassis power was off.\n\nBut I do see from your other comment, that pohTimer will start incrementing when this object is created. So when we first boot up the BMC, the counter will be running and when we power on, that time would have been counted. Is that what you\u0027re trying to fix here?",
