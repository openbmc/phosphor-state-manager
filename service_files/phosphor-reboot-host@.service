[Service]
# This service is running a script that is starting another target that
# conflicts with the target this service is running in. OpenBMC needs a
# refactor of how it does its host reset path. Until then, this short term
# solution does the job.
# Since this is a part of the reboot target, call the startmin
# target which does the minimum required to start the host if the reboot count
# is not 0, otherwise it will quiesce the host.
