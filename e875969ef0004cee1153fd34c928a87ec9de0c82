What is the default when no default is defined, empty? Would that be ok until determining the power state is run?",

      "message": "Yeah, I would have preferred we had a \"Undefined\" state defined in PDI. But, the good news here is that this only occurs when this application first starts up, and we don\u0027t put the property on D-Bus until the \"emit_object_added()\" call below and that\u0027s after we\u0027ve figured out the real power status. So the only real reason I added this init here is so we don\u0027t see it as a power status change and call APR on startup.",
