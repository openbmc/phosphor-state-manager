This should get rid of the lack of formatting. building and testing now.",

      "message": "I thought I sent the above earlier,but it was living in draft purgatory. Anyways, I know why \"snprintf\" was used for the reasons I listed above. I left the meson file \"as-is\" from my previous commit. However, I declared a string for the chassis_lost_power_file, since it was essentially the only way to format with fmt.\nI\u0027m totally indifferent whichever method would be preferred. Both have their benefits.\nMy main concern is that there is a lot of upstream code using fmt::format which produces cleaner, nicer looking source code, but will be incompatible with meson build settings that are denoted with \"%d\". \nThe snprintf method allows for the proper formatting to occur, but is rather ugly code IMO. \nMaybe pointing this out will prevent technical debt(or headaches) in the future.",
