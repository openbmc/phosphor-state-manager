      "message": "Hi @Thang,\nFrom the IPMI Specification v2.0 revision 1.1. \"The power restore policy determines how the system or chassis behaves when AC power returns after an AC power loss.\"\n\nIt seems both `Watchdog` and `Software` are not caused by AC power loss like `PinholeReset`.\nTherefore, checking the `PinholeReset` reason and not running power restore policy seems reasonable.\n\nSince it is a manual mechanism for the user to force a hard reset to the BMC in situations where it is hung or not responding, should we keep the hard reset `PinholeReset` and remove the software reset regardless of whether it is Watchdog or Software?\n\nHi @Andrew,\nIf I am wrong, please correct me. Thanks.",
