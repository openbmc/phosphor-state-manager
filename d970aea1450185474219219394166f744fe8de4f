      "message": "Hi @Thang,\nFrom the IPMI Specification v2.0 revision 1.1. \"The power restore policy determines how the system or chassis behaves when AC power returns after an AC power loss.\"\n\nIt seems both `Watchdog` and `Software` are not caused by AC power loss like `PinholeReset`.\nTherefore, checking the `PinholeReset` reason and not running power restore policy seems reasonable.\n\nSince it is a manual mechanism for the user to force a hard reset to the BMC in situations where it is hung or not responding, should we keep the hard reset `PinholeReset` and remove the software reset regardless of whether it is Watchdog or Software?\n\nHi @Andrew,\nIf I am wrong, please correct me. Thanks.",

      "message": "I think it\u0027s time to update https://github.com/openbmc/docs/blob/master/designs/power-recovery.md for both of these (similar to what was done for PinholeReset) because I\u0027m not sure we want these. The argument seems to be to only run APR when something unexpected happens (like an AC loss) but I think some want the Always Power On option to be always run after a BMC reset.",
