      "message": "I\u0027m not sure how Cereal works, but it may require the new field be at the end. One use case would be a system has the previous file, that only has the 3 entries in it. Your new code runs, which tries to load 4 entries from it. What\u0027s the behavior? Does it error on all of them, or restore the 3 and just ignore that the 4th that is not there. Once your code runs to store the values, the file will be good, so it\u0027s just that first case we need to think about. May be best to manually stop the state service, manipulate the file to only have 3, and see what happens when you start your code. The file is out in /var/lib/phosphor-state-manager/",

      "message": "Due to have issues launching simics(at the end of the day I was passing a bunch of flags that were unneeded, default worked PERFECTLY). Anyways I changed the cereal save/load to adding only retry attempts onto the end and removed attempts left entirely. I\u0027m thinking I can create another cereal class version to distinguish between these two cases? Cereal was working properly in this way however, the bmc did queisce once when I tested removing the retry attempts value from the \"runninghosttransition\" file that was generated by cereal.",
