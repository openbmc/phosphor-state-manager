The host shutdown target was not running since the host_crash target was hit first, and therefore was not not allowed to properly shutdown the host. You added a conflict with the host-stop target so that the crash target was not hit before the host-stop target. The script you added is then called during a phosphor-reboot service to apply the proper target to systemd.",
