BMC is coming out of reset, these targets are run, and host firmware is automatically started? I\u0027m just wondering why we don\u0027t just use the existing obmc-host-start@.target and obmc-host-start-pre@.target for this? Just load your appropriate services in those targets to coordinate the host power on.",
