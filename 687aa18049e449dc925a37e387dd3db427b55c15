      "message": "/run is a tmpfs file system in our system, and the file in question should be created by this code.\n\nIn the AC power-on case, the host-on file can be removed by startmin. However, in the BMC reboot case, we noticed that the file was not removed. During that time, if we execute a DC cycle or the on/off command, the power-on service will be blocked or ignored due to the condition ConditionPathExists\u003d!/run/openbmc/host@%i-on, which is included in most services.\n\nShould the host-on flag be removed after the power-on initialization is complete? Iâ€™m not entirely sure what this flag is used for.",
