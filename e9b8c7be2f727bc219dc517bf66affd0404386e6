When a call to phosphor-logging is made, systemd will automatically start it for you (dbus activation). Please be sure you\u0027re based on upstream code if you\u0027re not seeing this behavior.",

      "message": "I see. I could see the `xyz.openbmc_project.Logging.service` automatically run before `phosphor-create-chassis-poweron-log@0.service` even if we don\u0027t have the \"After\" dependency in systemd service. So I removed that change because it is indeed not needed.\n\nHowever, there is still a D-Bus service timing that needs to be resolved, so I have force-updated this change to have the fix. Could you please help take a look? Thanks!",
