      "message": "My only remaining concern is that we already log an error when BMC Quiesced occurs over in https://grok.openbmc.org/xref/openbmc/phosphor-state-manager/systemd_target_signal.cpp?r\u003d1b2c3c035ecd647cef996982df00378506f93887#53. This error provides more info (which target/service failed). Is that not good enough here? I get that there\u0027s some benefit in using the more \"standard\" errors like this but our systems can\u0027t be logging duplicate errors so we\u0027d have to add this new one to our ignore list which seems a bit onerous.",

      "message": "[LogError] appears to focus more on capturing service‑level information. I believe adding BMC state‑level information would help users more intuitively understand which state the BMC has entered, and the two sets of information can complement each other.\nAlternatively, we could consider merging both into a single event, but this likely requires feedback from reviewers.\n\n[LogError]: https://grok.openbmc.org/xref/openbmc/phosphor-state-manager/systemd_target_signal.cpp?r\u003d1b2c3c035ecd647cef996982df00378506f93887#53",

Only standardized events/errors will trigger Redfish push events (because while LogServices can hold non-standard events, the push part of the spec requires it).\n\nIf you want there to be an error for \"BMC Went into Quiesced State\" we can make a dedicated error for that (rather than this event).  We can add non-Redfish fields into events, to store the systemd service.  Take a look at `FailureData` in `State.Power.PowerRailFault` as an example.",
