      "message": "So, it seems to me like on a fresh boot of a system, it will not have retryAttemps set in the archive file initially. So do we read a 0 in that case? Are we then writing a 0 for retryAttemps? I wonder if we need a check to see if it\u0027s 0 and if it is, write the default value we read from PDI to it instead? To test, just stop the host state service, remove the cereal file from /var/lib/, start the host state app, and read the retryAttempts from D-Bus.",
