I do think though that we should update the documentation in https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-dbus-interfaces/blob/master/yaml/xyz/openbmc_project/Control/Power/RestorePolicy.interface.yaml#L12 to reflect that it is now the \"maximum time\" we will wait with periodic checks for BMC Ready. \n\nhttps://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-dbus-interfaces/commit/33c38cb266bf4fdc5a4aeb453d175763fd3bc9f8 was the commit that added it and it looks like it was x86-power-control specific.",

Can you add a little blurb to https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-state-manager/blob/master/README.md#restore-policy-on-power-events to note this new behavior in PSM and then we\u0027ll see if anyone else weighs in on this design.",
