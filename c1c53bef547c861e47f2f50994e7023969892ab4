      "message": "I removed this line because it didn\u0027t seem to make sense.\n\n1) I can\u0027t see any reference to scheduledhosttransition being passed to mapper.\n2) This service doesn\u0027t even create an object named /xyz/openbmc_project/state/scheduledhosttransition, so the mapper query should never complete if it existed.\n\nBut there might have been some subtlety that I didn\u0027t understand in how the service was ending up getting launched.  I suspect it was triggered off the busname, but I can\u0027t really find reference to ScheduleHostTransition elsewhere in the codebase either.  Please let me know if I\u0027ve missed something you remember.",
