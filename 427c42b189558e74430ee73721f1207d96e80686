Something else platform specific if phosphor-power is not suitable?) and that daemon would handle any actual power on/off actions?",

      "message": "Yeah, the (unwritten?) rule is that if you want to use phosphor-state-manager, something must implement the org.openbmc.control.Power interface if you wish to power on/off your chassis. Currently within OpenBMC that\u0027s either from the phosphor-power repo or the op-pwrctl piece of phosphor-skeleton.\n\nNext up after these changes is to take some of the community feedback and improve on PSM documentation.",
