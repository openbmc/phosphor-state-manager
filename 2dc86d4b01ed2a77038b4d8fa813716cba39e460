      "message": "oh shoot, I just realized that this property is \"The delay in microseconds before invoke power restore policy after\". It\u0027s in microseconds so 30 seconds is actually 30,000,000 for a 30s delay. Easiest to probably just use the \"std::chrono::microseconds\" chrono in the sleep_for below. And change this variable name to something like powerRestoreDelayUsec so it\u0027s obvious it\u0027s in microseconds.  No need to fully re-test, just be sure a value of 30,000,000 works as expected in simulation with your code change.",
