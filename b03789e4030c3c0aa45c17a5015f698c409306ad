      "message": "Yeah, that\u0027s a good point, we\u0027ve seen that in the past when we\u0027ve had issues with a common interface like mapper failing. I think in the end though, it\u0027s gotta be up to dump to serialize things. The good news is that we don\u0027t call this until the service has already restarted it\u0027s 3 times and is officially dead (and not starting back up).",
