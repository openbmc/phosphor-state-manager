      "message": "This host and chassis states are very intertwined. One valid use case is what you describe, the user has started a soft power off (wait for host firmware to properly shutdown) and they decide they do not want to wait so they issue a chassisoff to just skip to the hard power off. This will now require the user pass in the --force. The goal with this commit is to keep things very simple, obmcutil could quickly get out of control if it really starts trying to enforce state machine transitions.",
