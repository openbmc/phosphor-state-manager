      "message": "Why wouldn\u0027t we run the reboot target (or an openbmc-specific target that calls reboot) and if people want to add diagnostics inside there, they can do that?  Or, I guess people can add Before/Wants to this service if they want to run things?  \n\nI\u0027m not sure why we\u0027d want to add an arbitrary delay.  These things can be solved with systemd dependencies.",
